# IClass cipher

This is a reconstructon of the cipher engine used in iClass, an RFID techology developed by HID Global.
 
The implementation is based on the work performed by Flavio D. Garcia, Gerhard de Koning Gans, Roel Verdult and  Milosch Meriac in the paper "Dismantling IClass".

This implementation is not optimized at all, but is meant to serve as a reference implementation, and contains a lot of testcases.
